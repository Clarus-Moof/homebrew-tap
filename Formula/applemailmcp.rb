      AppleMailMCP is a local MCP server for Apple Mail.

      Add to your MCP client config (e.g. ~/.lmstudio/mcp.json):

        {
          "mcpServers": {
            "apple-mail": {
              "command": "#{bin}/AppleMailMCP",
              "args": []
            }
          }
        }

      On first use, macOS will ask for permission to access Mail and Contacts.
